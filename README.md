# Attendance System

This project is build on django python framework. In this project, face is recognize 
to mark attendance of employee. which is store in mongo db. we can also see all records
from web view.

## Optimizations

In this Optimizations are done by storing face encodings to mongobd agains all employee
image. Because encodings takes many time to compute result. so we store encoding of image
on the time of registration which produce 100 time better result than making encodins at runtime.
